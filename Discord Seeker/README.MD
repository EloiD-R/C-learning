# Discord Seeker

>This project is a program that asks you your discord tag then compare it to mine, this is a very basic program because it is literally my first in C (after the hello world one obviously).

> This project is composed of two files : `./src/Discord Seeker.c` and `./output/Discord Seeker.exe`,
> the `Discord Seeker.exe` file is compiled for windows so you'll need to recompile `Discord Seeker.c` if you are using an another OS.
