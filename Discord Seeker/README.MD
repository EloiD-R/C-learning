# Discord Seeker

>This project is a program that asks you your discord tag then compare it to mine, this is a very basic program because it is literally my first in C (after the hello world one obviously).

> This project is composed of two files : main.c and main.exe,
> the main.exe file is compiled for windows so you'll need to recompile it if you are using an another OS.
