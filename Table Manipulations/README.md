# Table Manipulations

> At base those functions were an exercise from the book : "Apprenez à programmer en C 2nd édition" (traduction from french : "Learn to program in C 2nd edition") wich is edited by OpenClassroom, i ameliorated the exercise a bit

> This is most complete and difficult project i made in c for the moment,
> The project is composed of three files : ./src/main.c, ./src/functions.h and ./output/main.exe.

⚠️ This program only works with int tables

> In the Table Manipulations.c file you'll find the functions that manipulates the table and a bonus function that make a demo of the functions, the functions are a sum of every value of the table, an average of them and a bubble sort algorithm to sort the values on ascending order, there is also a function that copy one into a second.

> In the Tables Maipulation.h file there is prototypes for the Tables Manipulations.C file with comments to describe functions.

> The Table Manipulations.exe file is compiled for windows so you'll need to recompile it if you are using an another OS, it uses the demo function of the main.c file.
