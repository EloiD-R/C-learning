# Table Manipulations

> This is most complete and difficult project i made in c for the moment,
> The project is composed of three files : ./src/main.c, ./src/functions.h and ./output/main.exe.

⚠️ This program only works with int tables

> In the Table Manipulations.c file you'll find the functions that manipulates the table and a bonus function that make a demo of the functions, the functions are a sum of every value of the table, an average of them and a bubble sort algorithm to sort the values on ascending order, there is also a function that copy one into a second.

> In the Tables Maipulation.h file there is prototypes for the Tables Manipulations.C file with comments to describe functions.

> The Table Manipulations.exe file is compiled for windows so you'll need to recompile it if you are using an another OS, it uses the demo function of the Tables Manipulations.c file.
